# Hands-On Session

In the following, we will guide you through all the steps required to model, deploy, and execute a hybrid quantum application using workflows.

The application is intended to automate route planning for package delivery drivers.
Thus, it includes splitting a graph with destinations to receive sub-graphs for each driver based on the truck capacity and the number and size of available packages.
For each driver, the optimal route is calculated for the sub-graph using the distances between the various destinations.

To solve this problem, the hybrid quantum application comprises classical pre- and post-processing steps, as well as the execution of two variational quantum algorithms.
Thereby, we will use the widely-known [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf).

The use case utilizes the Quantum Workflow Modeler and Quokka:

* [Quantum Workflow Modeler](https://github.com/PlanQK/workflow-modeler): A graphical BPMN modeler to define, transform, and deploy quantum workflows.
* [Quokka](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/Quokka): A microservice ecosystem enabling a service-based execution of quantum algorithms.

## Setup

The code required for the hands-on session is available [here](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2023-icwe).

As the hands-on session requires pushing your implementation from different steps to enable their reuse, start with forking the repository.
In the following, we will refer to the GitHub user to which the fork belongs as ``$GITHUB_USER``.

Afterwards, clone the repository and navigate to the ``2023-icwe`` folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USER/QuantME-UseCases.git
cd 2023-icwe
```

All components are available via Docker.
Therefore, these components can be started using the Docker-Compose file available [here](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2023-icwe/docker):

1. Update the [.env](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2023-icwe/docker/.env) file with your settings: 
  * ``PUBLIC_HOSTNAME``: Enter the hostname/IP address of your Docker engine. Do *not* use ``localhost``.
  * ``GITHUB_USER``: The GitHub user to which the fork belongs.

2. Run the Docker-Compose file:
```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up --build
```
3. Wait until all containers are up and running. This may take some minutes.

Open the quantum workflow modeler using the following URL: ``$GITHUB_USER:8080``

Afterwards, the following screen should be displayed:

Familiarize yourself with the workflow modeler by dragging and dropping elements from the palette on the right into the modeling pane.

## Part 1: QAOA for MaxCut

In the first part of the hands-on session, you will model and execute a quantum workflow orchestrating the [Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4028.pdf) to solve the Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem.
To model the quantum workflow, the [Quantum Modeling Extension (QuantME)](https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/Weder2020_QuantumWorkflows.pdf), as well as its extension for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), called [QuantME4VQA](https://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/publications/Beisel2023_QuantME4VQA.pdf), are used.

First, add a Warm-Starting Task after the initial Start Event.
[Warm-starting](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/7/1033/pdf) is used to approximate a solution that is incorporated into the quantum circuit to facilitate the search for the optimal solution.
Select the Task icon in the palette (1), drag it into the pane, click on the wrench symbol (2), and select the QuantME Tasks category in the drop-down menu (3).
Finally, click on Warm-Starting Task within the QuantME Tasks category.

![Modeler First Task](./resources/images/modeler-select-quantme.png)

Configure the Warm-Starting Task using the values shown below.
Thereby, ``Initial State Warm-Start Egger`` is selected as the warm-starting method, which was introduced in [this paper](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-06-17-479/).
Furthermore, we will use QAOA to solve the MaxCut problem, thus, select ``QAOA`` as the quantum algorithm to warm-start.
Finally, utilize the ``Goemansâ€“ Williamson`` algorithm to calculate the initial state to use, as well as ``10`` iterations to use for the approximation.

![Modeler Configure Warm-Start](./resources/images/modeler-warm-start.png)

Next, add a second task of type Quantum Circuit Loading Task to load to parameterized QAOA circuit that is later executed in the variational loop.
The functionality to generate a corresponding quantum circuit is provided by Quokka, therefore, configure the task using ``quokka/maxcut`` as URL.
Furthermore, connect both tasks with the start event using sequence flow.

![Modeler Configure Circuit Loading](./resources/images/modeler-circuit-loading.png)

Due to today's restricted quantum computers, the quantum circuit should be [cut into multiple smaller sub-circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01792), thus, reducing the impact of errors, as well as the limited number of qubits.
Add a Circuit Cutting Subprocess, which is also available within the QuantME Tasks category.
This subprocess must contain the complete optimization loop of the VQA, indicating that the corresponding quantum circuit should be cut before execution and the result should be combined before further processing it.
Thereby, use ``qiskit`` as cutting method, utilizing the implementation provided by the [Circuit Knitting Toolbox](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/circuit-knitting-toolbox/).
Additionally, restrict the maximum number of cuts, number of resulting sub-circuits, and their width as shown below:

![Modeler Configure Cutting Subprocess](./resources/images/modeler-circuit-cutting.png)

Expand the Circuit Cutting Subprocess to model the optimization loop:

![Modeler Expand Cutting Subprocess](./resources/images/modeler-circuit-cutting-expand.png)

First, add a Start Event for the subprocess and afterwards an Exclusive Gateway to later join the sequence flow of the optimization loop.
The first task within this loop is of type Quantum Circuit Execution Task to execute the loaded quantum circuit on a quantum computer.
For this example, we configure the task to use ``ibm`` as quantum hardware provider and the ``aer_qasm_simulator`` as QPU.
The aer_qasm_simulator is a simulator that can be executed locally to avoid queuing times.
Furthermore, the number of shots, i.e., the number of executions, is set to ``2000``, and it is specified that the circuit to execute was implemented using ``qiskit``.

![Modeler Circuit Execution](./resources/images/modeler-circuit-execution.png)

Executing a quantum circuit returns a probability distribution of different measured bit strings.
However, these bit strings must be evaluated to assess the quality of the solution they represent for the given problem.
For this, QuantME4VAR introduced the Result Evaluation Task.
Configure the task to use the ``Expectation Value`` as the objective function and ``maxcut`` as the cost function to assess the results.

![Modeler Result Evaluation](./resources/images/modeler-result-evaluation.png)

Afterwards, a second Exclusive Gateway is added to check if the results already converge.
If this is the case, the subprocess terminates with an End Event.
To evaluate the condition add the following expression to the sequence flow between the Result Evaluation Task and the End Event as also shown below: ``${ execution.getVariable('converged')!= null && execution.getVariable('converged') == 'true'}``

![Modeler Loop Condition 1](./resources/images/modeler-condition1.png)

If the results do not yet converge, the next iteration is entered by classically optimizing the parameters for the parameterized QAOA circuit.
This is done by a Parameter Optimization Task using the ``Cobyla`` optimizer.
All other attributes are optional and left empty for this example.

![Modeler Optimizer](./resources/images/modeler-optimizer.png)

Furthermore, another condition has to be added for the second outgoing sequence flow of the Exclusive Gateway: ``${ execution.getVariable('converged')== null || execution.getVariable('converged') == 'false'}``

![Modeler Loop Condition 2](./resources/images/modeler-condition2.png)

To finalize the subprocess, connect the Parameter Optimization Task with the first Exclusive Gateway using sequence flow.

The Result Evaluation Task generates an image to visualize the identified MaxCut.
Thus, add a User Task (1) to analyze this image and afterwards terminate the workflow using an End Event.
Configure the User Task with a form of type ``Generated Task Forms`` and add a form field to display the URL of the result image as shown below:
