# Tutorial Structure

The tutorial comprises six parts, including both lectures and practical activities:


- First, basic concepts and application areas of quantum computing are introduced. 
 This comprises the presentation of a broad picture of the technology including its history, hardware, software, and limitations. 
 Additionally, the basic working principles are outlined, and selected essential quantum algorithms for noisy and noise-free quantum computers will be explained.
- Second, a lifecycle for developing and operating hybrid quantum applications is introduced.
  It integrates the lifecycles of the different classical and quantum programs, as well as workflows, and shows their connection points.
- Third, the actual challenges of selecting existing quantum computers promising precise execution results based on given quantum programs are presented.
  Furthermore, a framework that tackles these challenges by enabling the automated selection of suitable quantum computers for quantum programs based on the requirements of the user is demonstrated.
-  Next, a concept for modularizing quantum applications in a service-oriented manner is presented. 
   To facilitate the integration of classical and quantum programs, a model-based orchestration approach using workflows is shown. 
-  Afterward, a practical session is planned in which attendees can model and execute a typical hybrid quantum application, solving the Maximum Cut problem with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm~(QAOA), using workflows.
    The required services will be provided and attendants will focus on orchestrating them to build the quantum application.
- Finally, the automated deployment of hybrid quantum applications using TOSCA is presented in a lecture and practically shown in a demonstration.
